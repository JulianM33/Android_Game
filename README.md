## A showcase of an android application I made

When first opening the application, a beginner screen with your highscore is shown.

The playing screen shows your score on the top and exclamation marks alerting the player of up coming obstacles

When a user crashes onto an on coming obstacle, the user is able to return back to the home screen or replay

A user is also able to log in to their Google Play account and place their score onto a global leaderboard.
